# SUSTech_CS324_DeepLearning_Ass1_MLP
## Instructions for Executing the Code
To execute the code, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**: Begin by creating a new Conda environment named mlp with Python version 3.9. This can be accomplished by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
conda create -n mlp python=3.9
```

2. **Activate the Environment**: Once the environment is created, activate it using the command:
```
conda activate mlp
```
3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the necessary Python packages, namely numpy, matplotlib, and ipykernel, by running:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib ipykernel scikit-learn
```
4. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository containing the code to your local machine by executing:
```
git clone https://github.com/Maystern/SUSTech_CS324_DeepLearning_Ass1_MLP.git
```
5. **Navigate to the Code Directory**: Change the current directory to the code subdirectory within the cloned repository:
```
cd SUSTech_CS324_DeepLearning_Ass1_MLP/code
```
6. Run the Jupyter Notebook: Finally, execute the `run.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the experiments and results. This can be done by launching Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and opening the `run.ipynb` file.
